Intrusion Detection Honeypot running NetCat in a bash script

I needed a tool to watch for potential internal attacks and easy to deploy.

Goals:
1. The device needed easy to deploy
2. Needed to detect connections to open ports
3. small and hideable, that could be left onsite.

What I created was a BASH, Bourne Again Shell not Shell, script to monitor connection traffic to a device that looked like a user's workstation on the network.
I used [Chris Sanders' Intrusion Detection Honeypot book](https://amzn.to/4eVSe4d) *amazon affiliate link, I earn from qualifying purchases* and [his sample script](https://github.com/chrissanders/idh) as a starting point.

This version was designed and runs on Debian 12, using the [debian netinst iso](https://www.debian.org/CD/netinst/). However, the same setup works on a Raspberry Pi (build and updated commits were from a Pi running Pi OS Bookwork). It can be a Raspberry Pi, Virtual Machine, or bare metal. I've run the device on all three platforms. All were Debian-based. Some changes may be needed for other Linux Distributions.

This Repo is more of a walk-through document than a clone and deploy tool.
