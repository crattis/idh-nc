# idh-nc
Intrusion Detection Honeypot running NetCat in a bash script

I needed a tool to watch for potential internal attacks and easy to deply.

Goals:
1. The device needed easy to deploy
2. Needed to detect connections to open ports
3. small and hideable, that could be left onsite.

What I created was a BASH, Bourne Again Shell not Shell, to monitor connection traffic to a device that looked like a user's workstation on the netowrk.
I used [Chris Sanderers Intursion Detection Honeypot book](https://amzn.to/4eVSe4d) *amazon affiliate link, I earn from qualifying purchases.* and [his sample script](https://github.com/chrissanders/idh) as a starting point.

This version was designed and running on Debian 12.
